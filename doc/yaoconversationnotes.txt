Physics volume and culling volume share tracking of which region (biiig bounding box) of the world the entity is in.
In voxel world, culling is "can you see chunk from other chunk"
Only "system"s in the ECS sense have mutable access to entities, the way scripts and non-ECS code writes to compnents / entities is through events.  
UUIDs used thoroughly.
Permissions/capabilities system used thoroughly (so long as they don't screw with performance).
